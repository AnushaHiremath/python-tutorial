# Python Practice Exercises

We are never fully trained and should therefore constantly challenge 
ourselves with old/new and simple/difficult tasks. Therefore I am 
starting this repository to improve my Python skills. 

The exercises were taken from:
* www.practicepython.org

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: **Character Input** (difficulty: :peach:)

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they 
will turn 100 years old.

*Extras:*

1. Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number 
and printing out that many copies of the previous message. 
(Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
2. Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. 
(Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

### Exercise 2: **Odd Or Even** (difficulty: :peach:)

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, 
print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd 
number react differently when divided by 2?

*Extras:*

1. If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
2. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and 
one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell 
that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
